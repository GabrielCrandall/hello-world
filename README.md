# hello-world
This is the GitHub tutorial project on creating a repository.

I am still learning to code, but I am getting better and better at it daily. When I am older, I plan to get at least a Master's degree in software engineering at Arizona State University. This is so that when I start my career,  I can become a software engineer.
